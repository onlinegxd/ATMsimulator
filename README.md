# ATMsimulator
My OOP endterm project

The most important classes are:
1) Main class (is where program run)
2) <abstract> Person and inherited User class (constructor for user and getters/setters to set and display information)
3) Login/Register User with validation and exception classes (e.g. if CardNum repeats or can't exist)
4) Classes to work with balance : Recharge/Transfer/Withdrawal (note! Transfer works only within user registered in system)
5) DBConnector to connect DataBase for program 

This project work simulates work of the ATM Banking system with possibilities to register and login, work with balance (recharge/transfer/withdrawal).
It's written on Java programming language with PostgreSQL DataBase system.

This project work is written by Zhernossek Daniyal, student of AITU SE-2011 group.
